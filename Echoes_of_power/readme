This is the implement of Echoes_of_power model.
paper link:
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Echoes_of_power.html

This project provides two basic functions.
1. returns the level of coordination between each pair in the data
2. predict the status using svm

You should provide a json file as the input.

The json should contain
	'id': unique ID of the utterance
    'replyToId': the id of the utterance to which this utterance was a reply to, -1 if this utterance was a root
	'unixReviewTime': the unix time extracted from the timestamp
    'profileName': profilename of the utterance
    'reviewText': the text of the utterance
    'consider'(optional, the default value = 1): whether this utterance is considered or not
	'status'(not necessary): to show whether the author is an admin

You can run main.py using your json file as input to get the result. The details are provided in code.

we use Wikipedia Talk Page Conversations Corpus as a example. You can find it in the former link.
In order to adjust the format of the input, run refine.py and main.py sequently.
 
If you have any suggestions or questions, please be free to contact me. 
It's my great pleasure to discuss with you.
